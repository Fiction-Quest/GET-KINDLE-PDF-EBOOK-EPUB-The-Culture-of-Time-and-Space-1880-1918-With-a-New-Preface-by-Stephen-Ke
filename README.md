Title: Changes Brought on by the Internet Age Pale in Comparison to Those of a Hundred Years Ago
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2015
Review: We live in a time of disdain for the past. I was explaining this to a friend of mine recently who, when I told him I just discovered a certain app, screwed up his face for a second and exclaimed, "That's so 2010, where have you been?" And that sentiment is all around us in a device driven environment in which having the latest thing is very important for the sake of having the latest thing. We are addicted, worse than any heroin addict is addicted to heroin, to "new and improved."

I begin with that brief scene because it would have been a familiar attitude in 1920. The idea that that which came before is automatically inferior to that which came after is a constant theme. Marinetti's Futurist Manifesto is essentially that statement: throwing past art and music over the railings of the "ship of modernity." His tone isn't almost hostile, it is.

The flip side to that hostility is the love of possibility. Imagine being born in the latter 1800s. You could have come into the world with no electricity, automobiles, telephones, airplanes, movies, or radio. And within your lifetime, they spring into existence. The Internet has changed textual approaches to information. A historian like Yuval Harari might argue that information transformations move humans closer to god like qualities and that in itself is a thunderously profound change. But it has not radically changed human life the way the technologies of the period covered in Stephen Kern's book have.

The Culture of Time and Space is a brilliant illumination of the Zeitgeist of the transformation to modernity. I love when historians do more than recount events. I'm also a fan of historians refraining from too much analysis. To me Kern hits the sweet spot of reporting on the past in such a way that meanings arise from the action--let the subjects of history be exalted or hang themselves in the telling of the record. Excellent monograph.

Title: Ambitious and wide-ranging cultural history that can be informative and insightful, but also far-fetched and exasperating
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2014
Review: At the simplest level, THE CULTURE OF TIME AND SPACE is a cultural and/or intellectual history of the period encompassed by the years 1880-1918, as refracted through the experiential prisms of time and space. On one hand, Kern endeavors to explain how technological, scientific, literary, artistic, and philosophical currents shaped the experience of time and space during that period. On another, he also at times undertakes a somewhat different and more dubious project: to show how the changing experiences of time and space influenced broad social and historical developments of the era, as, for example, modes of production, imperialism, patterns of diplomacy, and the means of waging war.

One small example of the sorts of relationships that Kern focuses on is how "the technology of speed" affected newspaper reporting and modified the language of journalistic communication. As the telegraph was increasingly relied upon to get stories from the field to the publishing desk and the printing presses, in order to reduce costs reporters were encouraged to write their stories with the fewest possible words. "The telegraph also encouraged the use of unambiguous words to avoid any confusion, and the language of journalism came to be more uniform as certain words came into more frequent use." In short, "the need for speed, clarity, and simplicity shaped a new 'telegraphic' style." From there, Kern goes on to posit that "no doubt" Hemingway's simplification of the English language "was in part a consequence of his experience as a foreign correspondent, obliged to prepare his articles for transmission over the Atlantic cable."

Kern explores these sorts of relationships and posits various causal connections in the realms of science, literature, philosophy, history, and the arts. It is in the realm of the visual and plastic arts that Kern is the most knowledgeable and convincing. In any event, THE CULTURE OF TIME AND SPACE is an ambitious and wide-ranging book. Far too ambitious and wide-ranging, to my mind. It does not adhere as a cohesive whole, and often Kern's observations and hypothesized relationships are too far-fetched and/or awkwardly jammed into his pre-existing theoretical construct. Nonetheless, there are many provocative ideas, some of which I find plausible. Few students of Western culture would not find the book worthwhile; by the same token, few would not also find it exasperating at times.

P.S.: My copy is the original 1983 edition. Accordingly, I have not read Kern's new Preface to the second (2003) edition.
